Storybook is all about writing stories. A story usually contains a single state of one component, almost like a visual test case.

> Technically, a story is a function that returns something that can be rendered to screen.

A Storybook can be comprised of many stories for many components.

## Location for Stories

There are no rules for this, but in general, stories are easier to maintain when they are located closer to components.

Some examples:

<details>
  <summary>stories inside component directory</summary>

  ```plaintext
  •
  └── src
      └── components
          └── button
              ├── button.js
              └── button.stories.js
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>stories sub-directory in component directory</summary>

  ```plaintext
  •
  └── src
      └── components
          └── button
              ├── button.js
              └── stories
                  └── button.stories.js
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>stories directory outside src directory</summary>

  ```plaintext
  •
  ├── src
  │   └── components
  │       └── button.js
  └── stories
      └── button.stories.js
  ```

</details>

It's up to you to find a naming/placing scheme that works for your project/team.

## Writing Stories

Here is an example of a basic story:
(Let's assume there's a component called "Button" in `src/components/Button.js`.)

```js
// file: src/stories/index.js

import React from 'react';
import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react';
import { action } from '@storybook/addon-actions';
import Button from '../components/Button';

storiesOf('Button', module)
  .add('with text', () => <Button onClick={action('clicked')}>Hello Button</Button>)
  .add('with some emoji', () => (
    <Button onClick={action('clicked')}>
      <span role="img" aria-label="so cool">
        😀 😎 👍 💯
      </span>
    </Button>
  ));
```

This will add stories in the storybook like this:

![Basic stories](../static/basic-stories.png)

This uses Storybook's basic API for writing stories. There are official and third party Storybook [addons](/addons/introduction) for more advanced functionality.

## Loading stories dynamically

Sometimes, stories need to be loaded dynamically rather than explicitly in the Storybook config file.

For example, the stories for an app may all be inside the `src/components` directory with the `.stories.js` extension. It is easier to load all the stories automatically like this inside the `.storybook/config.js` file:

```js
import { configure } from '@storybook/react';

const req = require.context('../src/components', true, /\.stories\.js$/);

function loadStories() {
  req.keys().forEach(filename => req(filename));
}

configure(loadStories, module);
```

Storybook uses Webpack's [require.context](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#require-context) to load modules dynamically. Take a look at the relevant Webpack [docs](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#require-context) to learn more about how to use `require.context`.

The **React Native** packager resolves all the imports at build-time, so it's not possible to load modules dynamically. There is a third party loader  [react-native-storybook-loader](https://github.com/elderfo/react-native-storybook-loader) to automatically generate the import statements for all stories.

## Using Decorators

A decorator is a way to wrap a story with a common set of components. Here is an example for centering all components:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react';
import MyComponent from '../my_component';

storiesOf('MyComponent', module)
  .addDecorator(storyFn => <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>{storyFn()}</div>)
  .add('without props', () => <MyComponent />)
  .add('with some props', () => <MyComponent text="The Comp" />);
```

This only applies the decorator to the current set of stories. (In this example, the decorator is added only to the **MyComponent** story group.)

It is possible to apply a decorator **globally** to all the stories. Here is an example of the Storybook config file:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { configure, addDecorator } from '@storybook/react';

addDecorator(storyFn => <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>{storyFn()}</div>);

configure(function() {
  // ...
}, module);
```

## Using Markdown

As of storybook 3.3, [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) can be used in Storybook by default. Users can import a markdown file which extracts the raw markdown content into a string. The string can then be used in any addon that supports markdown such as notes and info.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
import someMarkdownText from './someMarkdownText.md';

storiesOf('Component', module).add('With Markdown', () => <MyComponent />, {
  notes: { markdown: someMarkdownText },
});
```

## Searching

By default, search results will show up based on the file name of your stories. As of storybook 5, you can extend this with `notes` to have certain stories show up when the search input contains matches. For example, if you built a `Callout` component that you want to be found by searching for `popover` or `tooltip` as well, you could use `notes` like this:

```jsx
.add(
  "Callout",
  () => (
    <Callout>Some children</Callout>
  ),
  {
    notes: "popover tooltip"
  }
)
```

## Nesting stories

Stories can be organized in a nested structure using "/" as a separator:

```jsx
// file: src/stories/index.js

import React from 'react';
import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react';
import Button from '../components/Button';

storiesOf('My App/Buttons/Simple', module).add('with text', () => (
  <Button onClick={action('clicked')}>Hello Button</Button>
));

storiesOf('My App/Buttons/Emoji', module).add('with some emoji', () => (
  <Button onClick={action('clicked')}>
    <span role="img" aria-label="so cool">
      😀 😎 👍 💯
    </span>
  </Button>
));
```

## Organising stories with titles

Stories can be organized under a title using "|" as a separator:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react';
import Button from '../components/Button';

/**
 * The Button stories will show up underneath the 'Components' title.
 */
storiesOf('Components|Button', module).add('base', () => (
  <Button onClick={() => console.log('Clicked')}>Example Button</Button>
));
```

If you would prefer to use another character as the separator then you can
configure it using the `hierarchyRootSeparator` config option. Visit the
[configuration options parameter](/configurations/options-parameter) page to learn more.

## Generating nesting path based on \_\_dirname

Nesting paths can be programmatically generated with template literals because story names are strings.

One example would be to use `base` from [`paths.macro`](https://github.com/storybookjs/paths.macro):

```js
import React from 'react';
import base from 'paths.macro';

import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react';

import BaseButton from '../components/BaseButton';

storiesOf(`Other|${base}/Dirname Example`, module)
  .add('story 1', () => <BaseButton label="Story 1" />)
  .add('story 2', () => <BaseButton label="Story 2" />);
```

_This uses [babel-plugin-macros](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros)_.

## Run multiple storybooks

Multiple storybooks can be built for different kinds of stories or components in a single repository by specifying different port numbers in the start scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start-storybook-for-theme": "start-storybook -p 9001 -c .storybook-theme",
    "start-storybook-for-app": "start-storybook -p 8001 -c .storybook-app"
  }
}
```
