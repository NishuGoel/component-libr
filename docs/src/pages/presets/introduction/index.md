Storybook **presets** are grouped collections of `babel`, `webpack`, and `addons` configurations that support specific use cases.

For example, to write your stories in Typescript, rather than [manually configuring Storybook for typescript](../configurations/typescript-config/) with individual [babel](../configurations/custom-babel-config/) and [webpack](../configurations/custom-webpack-config/) configs, you can simply use the `@storybook/preset-typescript` package, which does the heavy lifting for you.

## Basic usage

Each preset has its own installation instructions, but the idea of presets is to simply install the preset and then load it.

For example, to get typescript support, first install the preset:

```sh
yarn add @storybook/preset-typescript --dev
```

Then load it in the file `presets.js` in your storybook folder (`.storybook` by default):

```js
module.exports = ['@storybook/preset-typescript'];
```

That's it. When Storybook starts up, it will configure itself for typescript without any further configuration. For more information, see the Typescript preset [README](https://github.com/storybookjs/presets/tree/master/packages/preset-typescript).

## Preset configuration

Presets can also take optional parameters. Sometimes these used by the preset itself, and another common case is to pass them through to configure webpack loaders that are used by the presets.

Consider this example:

```js
const path = require('path');
module.exports = [
  {
    name: '@storybook/preset-typescript',
    options: {
      tsDocgenLoaderOptions: {
        tsconfigPath: path.resolve(__dirname, '../tsconfig.json'),
      },
      include: [path.resolve(__dirname)],
    },
  },
];
```

This configures the typescript docgen loader using the app's `tsconfig.json` and also tells the typescript loaders to only be applied to the current directory.

Each preset has its own option and those options should be documented in the preset's README.
